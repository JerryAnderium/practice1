node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:19957:large black form, straight and erect, was walking beside her through
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:19989:venerable cut; black breeches, worn gray at the knee, stockings of
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:19990:black worsted; and thick shoes with copper buckles. He would have been
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:20532:woollen. Her skin was visible here and there and everywhere black and

node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:22136:long, low, utterly dilapidated wall, with a little black door in
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:22297:hovels, rubbish, ancient walls blackened like cerecloths, new white
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:22314:becomes frightful. The black lines sink inwards and are lost in the
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:22354:memorable morning in July, 1845,—black pots of bitumen were seen

node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:23153:perceived a sort of motionless, black statue at the corner of the lane
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:23214:As we have just said, on catching sight of that black silhouette
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:23231:He saw that black form standing out in relief against the white

node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:24044:black bread, a bottle of wine, and two glasses, and the old man was
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:24449:black, knotted, solid, which formed squares—I had almost said meshes—of
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:24487:upon, bearing a tablet of black wood. This box was grated, only the
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:24495:black shutters, re-enforced and fortified with transverse beams of wood
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:24514:with a black veil. One caught a glimpse of a black guimpe, and a form
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:24515:that was barely defined, covered with a black shroud. That head spoke
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:24519:you saw her in the white, and she saw you in the black. This light was
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:24591:Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga. They are clothed in black,

node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:25117:refectory. The walls were white, the tables were black; these two

node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:25294:destroyed in the Revolution; a reunion of all the black, gray, and
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:25523:black line of roofs which bordered the other side of the Rue Polonceau
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:25622:black shutters were replaced by brown curtains, and the parlor itself
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:25817:Catholic cloister, properly speaking, is wholly filled with the black

node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:28014:spread a large black cross, like a huge corpse with drooping arms. A
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:28017:uniforms trimmed with black walked on the right and the left of the
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:28073:black cross entered the avenue of the Vaugirard cemetery. The lame man
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:29280:in a black shroud, of woollen, which was heavy in summer and thin in
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:29475:rummages about, wastes time, blackens pipes, swears like a convict,
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:29513:daddy-long-legs, “the devil,” a black insect, which menaces by twisting

node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:30703:blackness. She cherished a frightful memory of her life; one day, a man
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:30927:tanned by the sun, his face nearly black and his hair nearly white, a
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:31858:firebrand, the azure is black, the stars shine; it is formidable.
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:31982:under his shirt, which was attached to his neck by a black ribbon.

node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:34224:had not put off his black garments. But his garments were quitting him.
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:34230:his coat black. As he wished always to appear in mourning, he clothed
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:34309:black. He had but three shirts, one on his person, the second in the
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:34394:black void in his heart; he would allow no one to mention the child to

node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:34982:blackguard! to go and vociferate on the public place! to discuss, to
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:35053:with thick and intensely black hair, a lofty and intelligent brow,
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:35121:hat, which always appeared to be new, a black cravat, a quaker shirt,
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:35132:scholars in a convent; it consisted of a badly cut gown of black
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:35241:and simple elegance, and without affectation. She wore a dress of black
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:35316:battered near the band, coarse carter’s boots, black trousers which
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:35317:showed white at the knees, and a black coat which was pale at the

node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:36073:ignorance, mingled with the human paste, blackens it. This incurable
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:36074:blackness takes possession of the interior of a man and is there
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:36132:with black, before he showed himself. At nightfall he emerged from the
node1/node13/node132/node1321/les_miserables.txt:36147:charming black hair, the brilliant light of springtime in his eyes; he

node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:2587:upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:2638:five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:2639:hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and

node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:3567:darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his

node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:3970:black cloud which rests upon their past.

node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:4838:dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:4891:steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:4902:lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:5418:“The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:5421:would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:5641:as black as a tinker’s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:5700:bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:5966:ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape,
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:6175:corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:6262:hand, recalled Holmes’ surmise as to his habits. His rusty black
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:6586:you were interested—white, with a black bar across the tail.”
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:6833:to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who

node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:7175:For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:7213:afternoon.” She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:7256:professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:8537:light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly,
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:8548:to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:9086:verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:9181:lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth.
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:9391:gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:9828:in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:9944:black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. ‘You have

node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:11631:these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:11803:the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.”
node1/sherlock_holmes.txt:11864:hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle

node2/node22/node223/node2231/huckleberry_finn.txt:1831:out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,
node2/node22/node223/node2231/huckleberry_finn.txt:1953:razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show. They
node2/node22/node223/node2231/huckleberry_finn.txt:2335:summer storms. It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black
node2/node22/node223/node2231/huckleberry_finn.txt:2342:blackest--_FST_! it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little
node2/node22/node223/node2231/huckleberry_finn.txt:2409:and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls
node2/node22/node223/node2231/huckleberry_finn.txt:2953:Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,
node2/node22/node223/node2231/huckleberry_finn.txt:3249:and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we
node2/node22/node223/node2231/huckleberry_finn.txt:3715:by the stars. I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the
node2/node22/node223/node2231/huckleberry_finn.txt:3984:of the bend. Is your man white or black?”
node2/node22/node223/node2231/huckleberry_finn.txt:4181:was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black
node2/node22/node223/node2231/huckleberry_finn.txt:4464:before--blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a woman in a slim black

node2/node22/node223/node2231/huckleberry_finn.txt:4467:a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and
node2/node22/node223/node2231/huckleberry_finn.txt:4468:very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a
node2/node22/node223/node2231/huckleberry_finn.txt:4479:one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was
node2/node22/node223/node2231/huckleberry_finn.txt:4586:a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so
node2/node22/node223/node2231/huckleberry_finn.txt:4588:you, as you may say. His forehead was high, and his hair was black and
node2/node22/node223/node2231/huckleberry_finn.txt:4618:shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes. They
node2/node22/node223/node2231/huckleberry_finn.txt:5063:warn't black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots
node2/node22/node223/node2231/huckleberry_finn.txt:5065:long black streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or
